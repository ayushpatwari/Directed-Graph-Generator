# Direct Graph Generator for Discrete Mathematics
### Why for Discrete Mathematics?
A major concept in discrete mathematics is graph theory. Graph theory is the study of graphs which are composed of nodes. In graph theory, individuals understand the relationships between nodes and various other attributes of the graph itself.
## What does this tool do?
This tool is a easy way to generate graphs for graph theory while also getting attributes (ie. concepts of trails, circuits, etc..) of the graphs. This can be used to analyze graphs in a better visualized manner and get information quickly.
## How to use this tool?
### Installation
Install all required libraries found in [requirements.txt](requirments.txt).
### Initialization
Using this tool is very simple.  
Simply, add all of your node values in the ```nodes``` variable. Then, place all your connections in the ```connections``` variable by adding it in the parathesis.  
### Further Functions
To further add nodes, use the ```add_node(value)``` method.  
To further add connections, use the ```add_connection(start_node, end_node)``` method.
